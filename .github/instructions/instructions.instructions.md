- Each file should have a single responsibility.
- Use components to break down complex functionality into smaller, reusable pieces.
- Focus on reusability.
- Before creating, check if a component already exists for that.
- Things should be in folders that make sense, categoryze stuff.
- Use `mv` or `rm` to move or delete files.
- Files cannot exceed 300 lines of code. Breaking it down if bigger.
- Don't use comments, remove the ones you see.
